# Atom syntax highlighting for TRS-80 Extended Color Basic 2.1

Based on Steven J. Syrek BASIC syntax highlighting for the Commodore 64, this version is customized to be used with Extended Color BASIC for the TRS-80 Color Computer.

This syntax highlighter supports the BASIC available in the Color Computer 3 (which includes commands like HCOLOR, HPAINT, etc...). It should work just fine with CoCo 1 and Coco 2 BASIC as well.

Contributions welcome if you seriously think this is worth extending any further!
